Deploys a directory via SFTP by these steps:
- Makes a tarball of the local directory
- Uploads the tarball through SFTP
- Extracts to a staging directory
- Swaps the staging and target directories
- Cleans uploaded file and old target directory

A configuration file called .sftp.json can also be used instead of providing options:

{
    "host": "ssh.example.com",
    ...
}

Explicitly provided options take precendence over those in the configuration file.
The keys in the .sftp.json file are the same as the long-form versions on the options.
